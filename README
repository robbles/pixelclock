== Pixel Clock ==

This project consists of four super-bright RGB LED matrices, each controlled by
a Rainbowduino board, and an Arduino Diecimila as the main controller board. An
XBee2.5 or similar serial interface can be wired to the hardware serial pins of
the Arduino to allow the time to be set remotely.

The Rainbowduinos must be arranged in series, with each one having an I2C
address of 1-4, depending on the position (i.e. the leftmost one is 1, and the
rightmost is 4). The Vin, GND, SDA and SCL pins on the Arduino should be connected to
the rightmost board, and the Arduino should be powered with an appropriate DC
adaptor (9V seems to work pretty well).

NOTE: this is really bright. Might want to put a piece of paper on top to avoid
scorching your retinas...


== The Code ==

The "controller" folder contains the firmware for the main Arduino controller.
The code currently assumes that the serial control communication is at 9600 baud.

The "rainbowduino" folder contains the firmware for the Rainbowduinos. Each
board must have a specific 7-bit I2C address, as explained above. You can
change I2C_ADDRESS to set the address. The board will also show
I2C_ADDRESS_CHAR in white when powered on to help orient the matrices.
